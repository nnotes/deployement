# STORY-TEMPLATE-VERSION: 4.3.0

* Deployment

  - NNotes _expects_ that running the plateform locally means that it will run
    identically in distant servers _so that_ deployment overhead is minimized to
    making the platform run locally only.

** Init State

   - Manual verification and deployements:
       - Once locally
       - Once on a distant server



** Problem

   - Meteor is a moving target => local and distant server deployements
     dependencies out of synch "often"

   - Distributed developpement => deploying plateform means synch all parallel
     project states into one cohesive plateform => monolitic deployed state
     built from distributed state out of synch "quickly" => need to track
     dependencies => horrible to do it manually



** End State

   - Deployed plaform state built from distributed state which are tracked.
     Based on this [[gfxmonk][use case]].
       - => no "under the hood" change

       - => rollback when necessary

       - => local deployment means identical distant deployment
